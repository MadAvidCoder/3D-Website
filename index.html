                    There is little point to this website, other than to endlessly watch a cube and donut <b>(do <i>not</i> question the donut)</b> endlessly spinning in an endless void of endless endlessness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This truly inspiring nothingness was created with three.js and javascript. And maybe Vite. And HTML and CSS of course.

            <section class="light">
                <h1>Ok, but seriously... What is <i>actually</i> going on here?</h1>
                <p>
                    As you scroll, the camera pans through an endless universe of nothingness. Because giving doom-scrolling the power to control an entire universe was a <i>great</i> idea. <i>(At the time at least...)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cube rotates. The donut rotates. Everything rotates. <b>ROTATION IS EVERYWHERE</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except the stars. They're normal. <i>(I think).</i>

                <h1>Things I learnt.</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>(Mostly Unwillingly)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned how not to break things (sometimes). Especially as it seems that a single typo can break the entire fabric of reality. (at least on this website).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I <i>may</i> have also learnt how to use three.js to move stuff. Cause manipulating reality is fun :D

                    Thank you for scrolling. The cube appreciates it.
